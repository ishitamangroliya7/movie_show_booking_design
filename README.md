Movie Booking Web Application =>

This project is a movie booking web application that allows users to explore available movies, select showtimes, choose seats, and confirm bookings. It features a user-friendly interface with multiple movie tabs, showtime buttons, and a seat selection.


Key Features =>

Multiple Movie Tabs: Browse through a selection of movies with individual tabs for each.

Showtime Selection: Easily pick a convenient showtime from the available options.

Seat Selection: Select your preferred seats with a visual seat map.

Booking Confirmation: Confirm your booking details, including movie, showtime, seats, and user names.

Demerits =>

Payment: This application does not support online payment. Bookings are confirmed through the interface, but payment must be made in person at the theater.

Responsiveness: The current design is not fully responsive and is optimized for screens wider than 1200 pixels.

Future Enhancements =>

Responsiveness: Improving the design for better functionality on smaller screens.

Payment Integration: Adding support for online payments directly through the application.
